<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>How's it goin', eh? (jk, im not canadian)<br><br>My name is Mark! (and the exclamation mark is important), and I'm just some guy on the internet that makes music, does stuff in linux (wow, ain't I a nerd?), and occasionally writes things. To find some specifics (links) to what exactly I've done, feel free to check out the <a href="projects.html">projects page</a> of this website. Pretty much the only thing that said projects page won't tell you is that I'm quite often sarcastic (but if you've read this far, you know that already).</p>

<h3>About This Website</h3>

<p>This website is my personal little project that serves in part as my personal portfolio, and in part as my own venue to talk about literally anything I feel like. I write this website from the ground up in HTML/CSS using the Pluma text editor. I host this website in <a href="https://github.com/MarkSilverMedia/personalsite">one of my github repos</a>, which is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (so feel free to fork my source code).</p>
