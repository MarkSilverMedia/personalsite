<h2>Tumblr Sucks</h2>

<p>Some time in the beginning of this month one year ago, I started <a href="http://emawm.tk">a particular web project</a> based around some ideas that myself and a friend were throwing back and forth in a Skype chat. In order to start this project, I set up a domain with freenom and connected it to a tumblr blog I made for this project. It's a method that I had used time after time as a way to host websites, and for all intents and purposes, it works. However, in time, I've developed my gripes with the service, and I will be expressing said gripes in this here post today.</p>

<h3>Inefficient Workflow</h3>

<p>Let me just take a moment to commend tumblr for being as much of a versitle blogging platform it is. From a user standpoint, if all you want to do is have yourself a nifty little blog that you can post just about anything to, tumblr fits the bill just fine. However, I'm more of a developer than I am a blogger, and EMAWM (my only web project still hosted on tumblr) often receives drastic changes in its layout and theme, on account of the fact that EMAWM is my web pet-project, and I like to play around with different ideas. From that standpoint alone, I can't stand working on code in tumblr's editor. For whatever reason, I have to edit both my CSS and HTML code in the same document. Believe me, I tried making a stylesheet on a separate page, but linking it to the main HTML was unsuccessful. Furthermore, tumblr lacks any sort of actual folder structure for static pages. Each custom page you create will show up in the aptly named section of the sidebar, and with no discernable organization.</p>

<h3>Shady stuff behind the scenes</h3>

<p>One of the issues that I noticed when playing around in tumblr's editor is that there are seemingly arbitrary restrictions on the javascript you can use on your website. For instance, I can create a random generator that picks from a list of possible options for what text to display in a particular section, but attempting to use the toggle function to show & hide different elements doesn't actually work on tumblr-hosted websites. In addition to this restriction, tumblr injects their own code into your HTML theme. If you compare the source HTML in the tumblr editor to that from the "View Source" option from your browser, you'll notice that there's some code around the head tag that you did not insert, and you don't have any way of removing it. As far as I know, this code is what gives them the ability to insert ads on your tumblr site. I was goofing around with an electron project and loaded up the EMAWM site in its window, and I quickly found, because electron doesn't have an adblocker, that tumblr puts an ad in the bottom-right corner of the page that you have to wait 5 seconds before you can remove. I did not know that this was occuring up until this point because I normally browse the web with an adblocker, and I encourage everyone to do the same. I do not endorse or condone any of the products/services that are advertised on EMAWM, as none of us at EMAWM have any control over them.</p>

<h3>So, why still use tumblr?</h3>

<p>I may or may not have mentioned earlier in this post that EMAWM is the last of my web projects that still uses tumblr as its hosting platform, and the reason that we still use tumblr is for convenience. I personally take no issue with writing each and every post I make to a static page of pure HTML/CSS, as I've been writing websites for years now. However, I need to be considerate of my fellow EMAWM contributors, who to my knowledge are less experienced in web development, and the truth of the matter is that tumblr is the most convenient platform for making posts in the manner that we do on EMAWM. However, I haven't entirely given up hope on an alternative. About a week ago, I started taking a look into Wordpress, which functions very similar to tumblr, but can be self-hosted. If I can figure out how to host a wordpress site in github (or if I get a server), I could see us migrating to that platform full time, as doing so would give full control of the website's underworkings back to us (mainly me, since I'm the developer in the room).</p>
