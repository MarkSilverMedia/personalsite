Hey, guess what?<br>
<br>
*the crowd says "what"*<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/marksilvermedia">I'm on twitch now</a>. Earlier today, I was improvising for a while on my MIDI keyboard, and decided to live stream it because why not. My first session didn't archive because I didn't realize that such a feature was turned off by default on twitch, but from here on out, you'll be able to see my streams from when they're live until 14 days after they end. Most of these streams are gonna be music stuff, but maybe I'll do something different every once in a blue moon (or whatever idiom the hip kids are saying these days).<br>
<br>
I would embed my twitch channel to this page, but that would slow down its loading time, & that's just not cool.<br>
<br>
Also, I don't really have a schedule for exactly when or how frequently I'm gonna livestream, but do feel free to follow me on twitch if you want to be notified whenever I do go live. ;)
