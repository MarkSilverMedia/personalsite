<ul>

<li>Each page on this website is written entirely in HTML/CSS. There is no javascript, and there probably never will be, because it does not need to exist on my website.</li>
<li>I do not place ads on this website, and nor does github. If you or your adblocker see advertisements on this website, your browsing experience was probably compromised by malware (which you can avoid by switching to a linux-based operating system).</li>
<li>I post links to external websites on some of this website's pages. I won't post a link to a site I wouldn't browse myself, but it is still your responsibility to browse at your own risk.</li>
<li>This website is free and open-sourced. You can <a href="https://github.com/MarkSilverMedia/personalsite">browse all of its code &amp; contents on its github repository</a>.</li>
